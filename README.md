On 14 Jan 2025 I received the following mail (Thunderbird as a mail program):

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bf2c6f3-4468-41a5-b0a2-40a812461fb1)

There are two attachments, a html file and a pdf. The pdf is suspiciously short and actually not a pdf at all.
The html file contains a javascript that downloads the trojan Wacatac.B!ml.
